FRONT-END ASSIGNMENT ROUND 
Problem Statement 
Create a Customizable Finance Dashboard where users can build their 
own real-time finance monitoring dashboard by connecting to various 
financial APIs and displaying real-time data through customizable 
widgets. 
Objectives 
1. Develop a user-friendly finance dashboard builder that 
supports real-time data visualization. 
2. Enable seamless integration with multiple financial APIs 
(stocks). 
3. Provide intuitive widget management with drag-and-drop 
functionality. 
4. Implement robust state management and data persistence 
capabilities. 
Technologies 
• Frontend Framework:Next.js  
• Styling: CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled-Components  
• State Management: Redux/Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai  
• Data Visualization: Chart.js, Recharts, or similar charting 
libraries  
• Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS 
Features 
1. Widget Management System: 
○ Add Widgets: Users can create new finance data widgets by 
connecting to any financial API- 
● Table: A paginated list or grid of stocks with filters 
and search functionality. 
● Finance Cards: A list or single card view for: 
○ Watchlist 
○ Market Gainers 
○ Performance Data 
○ Financial Data 
● Charts: Candle or Line graphs showing stock prices over 
different intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) 
○ Remove Widgets: Easy deletion of unwanted widgets from the 
dashboard 
○ Rearrange Layout: Drag-and-drop functionality to reorganize 
widget positions on the dashboard 
○ Widget Configuration: Each widget includes a configuration panel 
for customization 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. API Integration & Data Handling: 
○ Dynamic Data Mapping: Users can explore API responses and select 
specific fields to display 
○ Real-time Updates: Automatic data refresh with configurable 
intervals 
○ Data Caching: Intelligent caching system to optimize API calls 
and reduce redundant requests 
3. User Interface & Experience: 
○ Customizable Widgets: Each widget displays as a finance card with 
editable titles and selected metrics 
○ Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout supporting multiple 
screen sizes 
○ Loading & Error States: Comprehensive handling of loading, error, 
and empty data states 
4. Data Persistence: 
○ Browser Storage Integration: All widget configurations and 
dashboard layouts persist across sessions 
○ State Recovery: Complete dashboard restoration upon page refresh 
or browser restart 
○ Configuration Backup: Export/import functionality for dashboard 
configurations 
5. Advanced Widget Features: 
○ Field Selection Interface: Interactive JSON explorer for choosing 
display fields 
○ Custom Formatting: Support for different data formats (currency, 
percentage, etc.) 
○ Widget Naming: User-defined widget titles and descriptions 
○ API Endpoint Management: Easy switching between different API 
endpoints per widget 
API Integration Guidelines 
• Use reliable financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub,  IndianAPI 
etc.)  
• You'll need an API key to access the endpoints. Generate an API 
key for the app and check the limits on requests per minute and 
requests per day. 
• Implement proper API key management and security practices  
• Handle rate limiting and API quota management gracefully  
Technical Requirements 
• Follow a well-defined, scalable folder structure  
• Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code 
• Optimize for performance with lazy loading, code splitting, 
rendering strategies (CSR/SSR) 
Brownie Points  
Note: Focus on core functionality first. Once basic features are 
working, explore these advanced features: 
1. Dynamic Theme Switching: Implement a dynamic theme-switching 
feature that allows users to toggle between Light and Dark 
modes seamlessly. 
2. Real-time data: Implement sockets for live data updates over 
widget. 
3. Dashboard Templates: Pre-built dashboard templates for  
Evaluation Criteria 
This assignment evaluates:  
• Frontend Development Skills: React proficiency, component 
architecture, and modern JavaScript  
• State Management: Effective use of Redux/Zustand for complex 
application state  
• API Integration: Handling dynamic JSON data and implementing 
robust data fetching strategies 
• User Experience Design: Creating intuitive interfaces that 
non-technical users can navigate easily 
• Problem-Solving Ability: Implementing flexible solutions for 
diverse API structures and data formats  
• Code Quality: Clean, maintainable, and scalable code architecture 
FAQ 
API and Data Handling 
Q: How do I handle different API response formats? 
A: Implement a flexible data mapper that can handle various JSON 
structures. Consider creating adapters for common API formats. 
Q: What happens if the API request limit is reached? 
A: If the API request limit is reached, the website may temporarily 
stop fetching new data until the limit resets. You may see a message 
indicating that the API limit has been reached and suggesting you 
try again later. 
Q: How do I create a new API key? 
A: To create a new API key, follow these steps : 
1. Visit the API provider's website (e.g., Alpha Vantage). 
2. Sign in to your account or create a new account if you don't 
have one. 
3. Navigate to the API section or dashboard. 
4. Look for an option to generate a new API key. 
5. Follow the prompts to create and copy the new API key. 
6. Update your web application's configuration with the new API 
key. 
Q: What are common API errors and what should I do when API rate 
limits are exceeded? 
A:.Common API errors include exceeding the rate limit, invalid API 
keys, CORS and network issues. To avoid rate limit cache API 
responses. Also, each API provider has specific rate limits, which 
are typically documented on their website. 
Q: What should I do when API rate limits are exceeded? 
A:  For support or feedback, you can contact the team through the 
provided contact information in the email. 
All the best !!
